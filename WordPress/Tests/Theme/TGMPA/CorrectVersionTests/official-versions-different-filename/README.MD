### About these test files.

These are the official versions of TGMPA, but renamed to make sure that detection of the TGMPA class based on code rather than file name works correctly.

The `1.0.0` and `1.1.0` versions of TGMPA were actually called `auto-install.php`, so in those cases, the files have not been renamed other than to add the version nr.
